	<p>Hi there! Welcome to my page! My name is Jason and I love Shrek and the ginger bread man. I am a first-year engineering student at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. Since a young age, I've always been fond of building things from using lego bricks to slowly graduating to assembling full desktop computers. Now I enjoy buidling software by writing blocks of code.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/codebackground.png %}" alt="" style="width:150px; height:125px;"/></span>Currently, I am actively learning web development through the Odin project and personal projects, developing financial technology using python through NUFinTech, and furthering my object oriented programming knowledge through courses at Northwestern. I am seeking to gain even more experience in software development through an internship.</p>
